# WishLinks âœ¨  
A collaborative wishlist app that auto-fills item details from product links

## ðŸ“± Overview

**WishLinks** is a work-in-progress SwiftUI app that makes creating and sharing wishlists effortless. Whether you're planning a group event, organizing a potluck, or just tracking your own shopping list, WishLinks streamlines the process. Paste a product URL and the app instantly extracts the item's title, price, and image â€” no manual entry needed.

WishLists can be private and personalized, or collaborative and shareable â€” perfect for birthdays, team events, holiday gift exchanges, and more.
